Influence Minimization in Fake News Networks

## Research question:

“How can we effectively minimize the spread of fake news in social networks using optimization techniques on complex network structures?”

## The core goals:

Simulate fake news propagation on realistic network models
Apply and compare optimization algorithms to minimize influence
